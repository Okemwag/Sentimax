# Sentiment Analysis Data Engineering Project

## Overview

This project implements a scalable data pipeline for sentiment analysis on large volumes of text data. It combines data engineering best practices with natural language processing (NLP) techniques to process, analyze, and store sentiment insights from various text sources.

## Features

- Scalable data ingestion from multiple sources (e.g., social media APIs, CSV files, databases)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline
- Sentiment analysis using state-of-the-art NLP models
- Real-time sentiment scoring and batch processing capabilities
- Data storage solutions for both raw and processed data
- Visualization dashboard for sentiment trends and insights

## Architecture

[Include a simple architecture diagram here]

The project consists of the following components:

1. Data Ingestion Layer
2. Data Preprocessing Pipeline
3. Sentiment Analysis Engine
4. Data Storage Layer
5. Visualization Layer

## Technologies Used

- Apache Kafka for data streaming
- Apache Spark for distributed data processing
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, NLTK) for data manipulation and ML
- Docker for containerization
- Elasticsearch for data storage and querying
- Kibana for data visualization
- Airflow for workflow management
